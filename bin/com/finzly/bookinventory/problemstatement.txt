Problem Statement:
Develop a Java application that utilizes Hibernate's built-in functions to address the following scenario:
You are tasked with creating a database-driven application to manage a library's book inventory. The
application should allow users to perform the following operations:
1. Add a new book to the library's inventory, including details such as title, author, publication year,
and ISBN.
2. Search for books in the inventory based on specific criteria. Use Hibernate's built-in functions to
implement the following search options:
 a. Search for books published within a certain range of years.
 b. Search for books written by a specific author.
 c. Search for books with a specific title or containing specific keywords in the title.
 d. Search for books with a specific ISBN number.
 e. Display all books currently available in the library.
3. Update the details of a book in the inventory, including title, author, publication year, and ISBN.
4. Delete a book from the inventory.
Ensure that your application adheres to good code standards and clean code must be there .
